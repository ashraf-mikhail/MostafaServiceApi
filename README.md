# What I've done:
### changed the algorithm for the Fibo, I used the fast doubling algorithm, check [here](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-fibonacci-algorithms) for details
### I fixed a few bugs

# You will need to:
### 1. Change the token to match your token, the current one is random.
### 2. Commplete the unit tests to have a good test coverage, I've included a sample of tests

## Note:
the current api is already deployed [here](http://mostafaappaustralia.azurewebsites.net/api) you can try it with Readify portal, it will not affect your record as it has a wrong token.

Good Luck.
